# üëã Welcome OSPO Career Path Repo

OSPO Career Path is a set of vendor-neutral, open source, and free courses created by folks from the TODO / OSPO community to support training inside the organization. Each course is intended to be modularized so the content is reusable in a piecemeal fashion.

The target audience of the OSPO Career path is intended to Open Source professionals that are in a role that manages, oversees, or guides the organization‚Äôs policies and/or contributions to open source projects. This includes:

* Security, compliance, and licensing open source roles
* Open Source developer relations, developer advocates, or community managers
* Open Source project managers
* Open Source leaders and general managers

## üß© OSPO Career Path Scope and Mission

The OSPO Career Path is led by participants from the [OSPO Career Path Working Group](https://lists.todogroup.org/g/WG-ospo-career-path). This working group has identified four different types of personas that engage in an OSPO at some level:

* (1) Open Source / OSPO managers shaping the process within an organization
* (2) Open Source / OSPO contributors within an organization (code and non-code contributors)
* (3) Open Source / OSPO managers executing the process (e.g Project Managers, DevRels, etc)
* (4) Software staff within an organization that is involved in using open source software

The scope of the OSPO Career Path focuses on persona (1) and (2) and works together with the LF Training & Certification team to turn the free modules developed in the working repo into future courses that will be part of the best practices catalog.
